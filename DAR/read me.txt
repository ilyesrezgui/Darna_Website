the process is : 
1) open the sign up or the sign in page 
2) create an account or log in into an existing account
3) at this stage the index page is going to pop in 
4) you can check one of the houses available in there or check the stories part (static pages that tell a story about places)
5) once you open a property's page you can make a reservation 
6) you can the  update your reservation or delete it 


NB: all properties are made into different pages so the images and the other things are not loaded from the data base
